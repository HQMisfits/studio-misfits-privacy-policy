Last Updated: 2 February 2026
This Privacy Policy explains how Studio Misfits (“we”, “us”) handles personal data in connection with the PC game Ye Old Seadog (the “Game”), distributed via Steam.
________________________________________
1.	Data Controller
The data controller for the purposes of applicable data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Turkish Law on the Protection of Personal Data No. 6698 (KVKK), is:
Studio Misfits

________________________________________
2.	Personal Data Processing
Studio Misfits does not collect or store personal data.
The Game operates without user accounts, developer-operated servers, analytics systems, or persistent logs controlled by Studio Misfits.
Multiplayer gameplay uses peer-to-peer (P2P) networking, which may require the temporary processing of IP addresses between players as a technical necessity.
Studio Misfits does not log, retain, or store IP addresses, and such data is processed only transiently in memory for connectivity purposes.
________________________________________
3.	Purpose and Legal Basis of Processing
Any limited, transient data processing occurs solely to:
•	Enable multiplayer gameplay connectivity
The legal basis for such processing is:
•	Performance of a contract (GDPR Art. 6(1)(b))
•	Legitimate interest in ensuring technical functionality (GDPR Art. 6(1)(f))
•	Equivalent necessity grounds under KVKK
________________________________________
4.	Third-Party Services
The Game relies on third-party platforms and technologies that may independently process personal data under their own privacy policies, including:
•	Valve Corporation (Steam / Steamworks) (https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy)
•	Unity Technologies (https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy)
Studio Misfits does not control or access data processed by these third parties.
________________________________________
5.	Data Retention
Studio Misfits does not retain personal data.
Any technical data processed for gameplay connectivity exists only temporarily during active gameplay and is automatically discarded.
________________________________________
6.	Your Rights
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights including the right to access, correct, delete, or object to the processing of personal data, and to lodge a complaint with a competent supervisory authority.
Because Studio Misfits does not store personal data, these rights may be technically inapplicable in practice.
Requests may nevertheless be submitted via the contact email above.

7.	Changes to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated if required by legal, technical, or feature-related changes. The “Last Updated” date will reflect any revisions.
