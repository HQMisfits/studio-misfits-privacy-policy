<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p class="meta"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 2 February 2026</p>

<p>
This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Studio Misfits</strong> (“we”, “us”)
handles personal data in connection with the PC game
<strong>Ye Old Seadog</strong> (the “Game”), distributed via Steam.
</p>

<h2>1. Data Controller</h2>

<p>
The data controller for the purposes of applicable data protection laws,
including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Turkish
Law on the Protection of Personal Data No. 6698 (KVKK), is:
</p>

<p>
<strong>Studio Misfits</strong><br>
<strong>Contact Email:</strong> hqmisfits@gmail.com
</p>

<h2>2. Personal Data Processing</h2>

<p>
Studio Misfits does not collect or store personal data.
</p>

<p>
The Game operates without user accounts, developer-operated servers,
analytics systems, or persistent logs controlled by Studio Misfits.
</p>

<p>
Multiplayer gameplay uses peer-to-peer (P2P) networking, which may require
the temporary processing of IP addresses between players as a technical
necessity. Studio Misfits does not log, retain, or store IP addresses, and
such data is processed only transiently in memory for connectivity purposes.
</p>

<h2>3. Purpose and Legal Basis of Processing</h2>

<p>
Any limited, transient data processing occurs solely to enable multiplayer
gameplay connectivity.
</p>

<p>
The legal basis for such processing is performance of a contract and
legitimate interest under GDPR, and equivalent necessity grounds under KVKK.
</p>

<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>
The Game relies on third-party platforms and technologies that may
independently process personal data under their own privacy policies,
including:
</p>

<p>
• Valve Corporation (Steam / Steamworks)<br>
• Unity Technologies
</p>

<p>
Studio Misfits does not control or access data processed by these third
parties.
</p>

<h2>5. Data Retention</h2>

<p>
Studio Misfits does not retain personal data.
</p>

<p>
Any technical data processed for gameplay connectivity exists only
temporarily during active gameplay and is automatically discarded.
</p>

<h2>6. Your Rights</h2>

<p>
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights under applicable data
protection laws, including the right to access, correct, delete, or object
to the processing of personal data, and to lodge a complaint with a
competent supervisory authority.
</p>

<p>
Because Studio Misfits does not store personal data, these rights may be
technically inapplicable in practice. Requests may nevertheless be submitted
via the contact email above.
</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated if required by legal, technical, or
feature-related changes. The “Last Updated” date will reflect any revisions.
